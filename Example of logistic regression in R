#Check missing values and fill in with the mean.
#Can also fill in with mode (most frequent value), or drop column if nearly all values missing.
#Or use other values in record to infer the missing value.
#For example, in Excel can look at occupation in a record with missing income value, with a table of income averages for different occupations to infer the missing values.
#Then can match or vlookup to insert the missing value from the occupation average income table, then set cells as being either above or below $150k.
